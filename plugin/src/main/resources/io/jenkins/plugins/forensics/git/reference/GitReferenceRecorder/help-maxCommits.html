Defines the maximum number of commits that will be inspected to find the intersection between the current branch
and the target branch (main branch). The default value is 100 commits. If a branch has more than the specified number
of commits (since the last merge with the main branch), then the reference finder will stop and return an empty result.
This helps to skip computations of delta results that contain too many differences.
